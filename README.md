# AR_Robot-assembly-kit
This project is an interactive Augmented Reality (AR) application built with Unity. It allows users to assemble a 3D robot model using intuitive drag-and-drop controls. The application features a detailed assembly mode with a scoring system and an "exploded view" to explore the robot's individual components. This project demonstrates key concepts in AR development and interactive 3D object manipulation.


Key Features:

•	Interactive Drag-and-Drop: Seamlessly drag and place robot parts to their correct locations.

•	Exploded View Mode: A dedicated scene to visualize all the robot's components in a disassembled state, with options to rotate the model.

•	AR-Ready: Built with AR Foundation (or similar) to project the robot into your real-world environment.

•	Multiple Scenes: A clear user flow from a home screen to dedicated assembly and exploration views.
